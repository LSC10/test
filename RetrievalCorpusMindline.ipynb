The experience described as clinical depression differs from this because of the impact, and the length of time a person feels sad. People with depression also talk about other experiences, such as finding it hard to concentrate, feeling hopeless, having low motivation, or not wanting to do things they used to enjoy.Sometimes, talking about depression isn't enoughThe experience of depression can have some people feeling isolated and alone, even if their friends and family are supportive and trying to help. An important part of the recovery journey is looking for mental health professionals who can offer treatments and strategies.Depression isn’t the same as being lazyExperiencing depression can mean that people struggle to get out of bed, get to school or work, or take part in activities that they used to enjoy. This can make them look like they're not trying hard enough. However, the misconception that they are lazy or weak can make it more difficult for them to seek help and recover.Depression can affect anyonePeople of all races, sexes and classes can be affected by depression. For some people who experience depression, patterns of critical self-thinking can be traced back to troubles in childhood. For others, there may not be a clear answer or explanation.No one chooses to have depressionPeople don't choose to be depressed. Telling a person with depression to cheer up or to ‘snap out of it’ can be harmful and can leave them feeling more isolated.Getting help can be really hardFor many people, depression can bring feelings of shame or hopelessness, and a sense of being broken or unworthy. This can make it a huge struggle to ask for support, or to get help to make things better. There are many options for treating depressionDepending on the severity and cause of the depression, different treatment methods are available, which are research-based and provided by mental health professionals. It's important that you feel comfortable with the mental health professional you choose to work with.Click to read full articleIs this article useful?Leave your review!\"),\n",

This implies some level of reciprocity in the relationship, and when you feel like you are being consistently shortchanged, remind yourself that it’s okay to share your feelings with your friend.Rules of communication and conflict mediation1.Let your friend know that you would like to have a discussion about the relationship2.Choose a time and place that is agreeable for both of you and be sure to choose as neutral a place as you can3.Always use '/I statements'.
